How to for the layouts

Few notes:
	- to use in the activity's layout (sits directly underneath the parent layout (e.g. RelativeLayout) in both the XML and Component Tree)
		<include layout="@layout/[layoutname]">
	- with all the layouts you will need to add the header text in the top blue bar within the activity's layout file. the style for this is @styles\headerText. 
	  if you have the text view mostly centered on the blue bar, it should sit in the centre.
	- don't forget to wire up the buttons in the layouts in the activities
	- make sure in the top layout tag of the activity's XML that there isn't any padding otherwise there will be some screwy looking stuff happening

	- generic_layout - used as an <include> on the other layouts
	- generic_layout_without_menu - used in the menu activity layout
